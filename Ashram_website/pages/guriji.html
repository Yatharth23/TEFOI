It is said that whenever a person who has to emerge as a yogi or a God-realized person comes into the world, he invariably provides certain clear
signs & indications about it at right time of his birth. True to this statement, on the very night of birth of Dr. B.S. Goel, his mother saw a
dream which contained an unmistakable indication about his future realization.  His mother saw in the dream that she went to har ki pouri	in
Haridwar alongwith the new born child.  The child slipped out of her hands and fell in to the running stream of holy Ganga.  She stood at the bank 
in great anxiety no exactly knowing what to do to save the child but within moments she saw that the child emerged safe and sound out of choti
of the statue of Lord Shiva which was there in water itself.  The dream is more significant as the emergence of someone through the choti of 
Lord Shiva is connected with the kundalini process and is clear sign of God-realization of merger of the individualized and embodied consciousness (jiva) into absolute consciousness (Shiva).  The mother had some inclining about the spiritual import of the dream.  When guruji underwent
great psychic and emotional suffering in his life due to some sort of paranoid depression, she narrated this dream to him and told him, "You need not to worry, you will see God one day".<br><br>

At the age of 4 or 5 years he used to see a peculiar vision with an inward eye which was always related to coming of a saint like person out
of the boundary of his abode and proceeding towards a crowd.  Only after going to the Vrindavanam Ashram of Bhagwan Sri Satya Sai Baba in 1972 he could vividly
recall that what he saw inside at the age of 4 or 5 years was nothing but the scene in which Baba same out of the boundary of his bungalow and 
proceeded towards the people.  This indicates that the relationship of Guruji and his Guru was inborn and predetermined.<br><br>

When he was only 13 years of age, a yogi came to his school and perform numerous yogic asanas before the morning assembly of staff and students.
After returning of from school, he started performing all the asanas without much difficulty as if he was already as adept in that field.<br><br>

When he was 14 years, a well known spiritual personage of a temple came to his father's shop. He saw the boy sitting on the shop and continued 
staring at him for some moments and then asked him to daily read a particular portion of a famous religious book Durga-Saptsthi in the morning.
He also told his father that the boy would attract the special grace of Goddess Mother. Guruji did this exercise with great passion and 
devotion and was surprised that every now and then he would see Goddess-Mother Durga sitting on a lion in his dream. The most surprising aspect
of the dream used to be that She would always communicate him something related to the future which would invariably come true. He was, however, not able to understand and appreciate the significance of all this at that stage.<br><br>
After joining college at the age of 16 years, he grew more and more introvert. This introversion sharpened his inner imaginations as a result
which he wrote short stories in Urdu which were published in the leading Urdu news of those days. At the age of 20, he started coming heavily
under the influence of Marxist thought. He acted like a Marxist in thought and action and also contributed a number of small articles to 
many leading English Newspapers reflecting his clear preference for Marxist values.<br><br>
But, in spite of all this, a strong under-current of religious thinking alongside with great passion for physical yoga and pranayama continued
in him. Because of his yogic practices, he got his Kundalini activated at the age of 28 years. He went into a state of great bliss for about 
eight days, found the whole world silvery white and beautiful composed poems in english without ever having background in such writing, and
reported to his friends that he saw Lord Jesus Christ in his heart which no one accepted  due to some reason,after eight days of state of bliss
he went into a state of severe paranoid depression.<br><br>

This depression and the state of extreme suffering took him to many persons which included tantriks, yogis, vaids and hakims, doctors and 
physchaitrists.
He took classical physco-analysis for four a half years to get rid of this depression. During this period of physco-analysis,  he forsook Marxism as a very very inadequate philosophy of life and became a votary of Freed who, he felt on the basis of his personal experience, understood the meaning and problems of life in a much deeper and better way than Marx did. Under the influence of physco-analytical thought, he also undertook the practice of those days. However, under some mysterious force, he also undertook the practice of meditation in a very serious 
way, not with any intension to realize God or anything of the sort but only because it produced feelings of great peace in him and also 
sharpened his self-witnessing power which helped him a great deal in self-analysis.<br><br>
The experiences in meditation led him on the path of inner spiritual evolution without any awareness on his part that a great phenomenon
was taking place in his life which would turn him dust into Divinity. It was in early seventies when he was about 35 years old, Bhagwan Sri 
Satya Sai Baba appeared in his dream and told him that everything was happening according to His Will for a particular purpose of exposing 
the limitations of both Marxism and physco-analysis which are false in ultimate analysis and cannot provide happiness to the individual.
He indicated to him that the Godward inner path is the only path to achieve ananda and peace.<br><br>
In 1975, when he was 40 years of age,he got his THIRD EYE opened through the mercy of Bhagwan Sri Satya Sai Baba and saw the Lord in His various
Forms. His kundalini also got activated because of which he had to pass through certain painful sufferings in order to be free for inner 
bandages. From 1976, he started doing work for the religions-spiritual regeneration of people right at his residence. It was in early 1982 that
powerful waves started coming to him an institution and some ashram to do the work in a more organized way. With the inner permission of 
his Guru, he founded a society in 1982 under the title THIRD EYE FOUNDATION OF INDIA for organizing and doing religions-spiritual work.
